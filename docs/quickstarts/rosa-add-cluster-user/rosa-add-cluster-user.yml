  prerequisites:
    - You must have a ROSA cluster.
    - You must be a cluster owner, cluster editor, or Organization Administrator for the cluster.
    - You must know the user identifier of the person that you want to add.

  description: |-
    Add new cluster administrative users to your existing ROSA cluster.
  introduction: |-
    If you create or manage a ROSA cluster, you can add additional cluster administrative users to that cluster.

    The user who created the cluster or users with specific permissions can add the `dedicated-admin` or `cluster-admin` cluster administrative user roles to a cluster.

    - A `dedicated-admin` user role has elevated permissions from a normal cluster user. For more specifics about these permissions, see the [documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/introduction_to_rosa/policies-and-service-definition#rosa-sdpolicy-customer-admin-user_rosa-service-definition).
    - With the `cluster-admin` user role, users are given full administrative access to the cluster. This is the highest level of privilege available to users. It should be granted with extreme care, because it is possible with this level of access to get the cluster into an unsupportable state.

    In this quick start, you'll add new cluster administrative users to your cluster.

    [As a best practice, limit the number of cluster-admin administrative users to as few as possible.]{{admonition note}}

      description: |-
        To add new cluster administrative users to your cluster:

        1. Go to **Cluster List**.
        1. Click your cluster's name to view cluster details.
        1. Click the **Access control** tab.
        1. Click the **Cluster Roles and Access** tab.
        1. Click the **Add user** button.
        1. In the **User ID** field, add the name or user identifier of the user you want to add to your cluster. User IDs are matched by the cluster's identity providers.
        1. Select which Group the user will belong to. You can choose between dedicated-admins and cluster-admins.

            a. For more information on `dedicated-admin`, see [the documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/introduction_to_rosa/policies-and-service-definition#rosa-sdpolicy-customer-admin-user_rosa-service-definition).

            b. For more information on `cluster-admin`, see [the documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_service_on_aws/4/html/introduction_to_rosa/policies-and-service-definition#rosa-sdpolicy-cluster-admin-role_rosa-service-definition).

        1. Click **Add user**.

        Your new cluster administrative user is now added to your cluster.

  # optional - the task's Check your work module

        instructions: |-
          - Does your new user appear in the list of cluster administrative users for your cluster?
        failedTaskHelp: Try following the steps again.
  # optional - the task's success and failure messages
      summary:
        success: Shows a success message in the task header
        failed: Shows a failed message in the task header
  conclusion: |-
        Congratulations, you added a new cluster administrative user to your cluster!

        After completing this quick start, you've learned how to add new cluster administrative users. These new users can perform administrative tasks on the cluster. Repeat the steps to add more users if you desire.

        Optionally, to remove cluster administrative users you have added, click the options icon (â‹®) > **Delete**.
